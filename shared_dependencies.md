As the files are ColdFusion Component (CFC) files, they will share some common dependencies related to ColdFusion language and its libraries. Here are the shared dependencies:

1. ColdFusion Runtime: All the files will depend on the ColdFusion runtime environment to execute the code.

2. ColdFusion Libraries: They will share common ColdFusion libraries for various functionalities like string manipulation, date and time functions, array functions, etc.

3. API Access Functions: If the CFCs are accessing APIs, they will share common functions for HTTP requests like cfhttp, cfhttpparam, etc.

4. JSON/XML Parsing Functions: If the APIs return data in JSON or XML format, they will share common functions for parsing these data formats like DeserializeJSON, ParseXML, etc.

5. Database Connection: If the CFCs are interacting with a database, they will share common functions for database connection, query execution, and result fetching.

6. Error Handling Functions: They will share common error handling and logging functions.

7. Shared Variables: If there are any shared variables, they will be declared in the Application.cfc file and can be accessed by all the CFCs.

8. Function Names: The function names used in one CFC should not be repeated in other CFCs to avoid confusion and errors.

Please note that the exact names of the shared dependencies will depend on the specific functionality of each CFC.
